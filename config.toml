#   Contact page
#      Since this template is static, the contact form uses www.formspree.io as a
#      proxy. The form makes a POST request to their servers to send the actual
#      email. Visitors can send up to a 1000 emails each month for free.
     
#      What you need to do for the setup?
     
#      - set your email address under 'email' below (it is also used in Gravatar for the bio).
#      - upload the generated site to your server
#      - send a dummy email yourself to confirm your account
#      - click the confirm link in the email from www.formspree.io
#      - you're done. Happy mailing!
